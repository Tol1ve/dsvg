**D-SVG: Diffusion Based Slice-to-Volume Generation with Implicit Neural Representation for Fetal Brain MRI**


## 🧠 Overview

Reconstructing high-quality **3D fetal brain MRI volumes** from motion-corrupted **2D slice stacks** is essential for accurate prenatal diagnosis. However, fetal MRI acquisition is often affected by motion artifacts, inconsistent slice contrast, and incomplete brain extraction regions.

To address these challenges, we propose **D-SVG**, a novel framework that integrates:

* **Diffusion models** for anatomical prior generation
* **Implicit Neural Representation (INR)** for slice fidelity refinement

Unlike traditional slice-to-volume reconstruction methods, D-SVG formulates the task as **3D volume generation guided by scanned slices**, enabling more robust reconstruction under severe motion corruption. 

---

## 🚀 Method Overview

The D-SVG framework consists of two main components:

### 1️⃣ Diffusion-based Volume Prior Generation

A conditional **3D diffusion model** is used to generate a plausible brain volume prior.

Inputs:

* Noisy volume
* Estimated brain mask

The diffusion model learns anatomical priors from fetal brain volumes and generates structurally consistent templates.

---

### 2️⃣ Slice-Constrained Fidelity Refinement

An **Implicit Neural Representation (INR)** is introduced to enforce consistency between the generated volume and the scanned slices.

The refinement process contains three stages:

1. **Volume Prior Embedding**
2. **Slice Constraint Optimization**
3. **Volume Sampling and Noise Injection**

The INR network models voxel intensities as a continuous function, allowing reconstruction with arbitrary resolution.

## 📊 Experimental Results

Experiments were conducted on both **clinical fetal brain MRI** and **simulated datasets**.

The proposed method achieved superior performance compared with existing reconstruction methods:

| Method      | PSNR      | SSIM      | NCC       |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| SVRTK       | 12.81     | 0.926     | 0.711     |
| NIFTYMIC    | 17.06     | 0.930     | 0.357     |
| SVR + SVoRT | 19.19     | 0.934     | 0.784     |
| NeSVoR      | 20.75     | 0.931     | 0.761     |
| **D-SVG**   | **21.69** | **0.940** | **0.866** |

D-SVG demonstrates improved structural consistency and reduced reconstruction artifacts.
